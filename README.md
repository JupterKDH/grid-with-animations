# this is the adaptation of the grid project with animations (space cream) for the desktop version.

In this challenge we will use:

- Grid;
- Animations and transitions, as seen in class;
- Media queries;

## in addition, one more challenge we have is to place elements that only appear in the desktop version, making them disappear when switching to the mobile version.
